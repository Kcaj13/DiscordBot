<h1>Discord Quiz Bot</h1>
</div>

A Discord Quiz Bot developed using JavaScript and Discord.js.

## Description

The Discord Bot web scrapes questions from trivia sites using cheerio. A random question is then selected and sent to the chat. Members have 60 seconds to answer the questions. If answered correctly they earn one point, otherwise a new question is asked.

Players points are stored using SQLite.

A leaderboard can be viewed using the command '/leaderboard'.

## Road Map

This is the first version of my project and I plan on adding and improving features in the future. Some improvements include:

- Using embedded messages
- Allow close answers to be considered correct
